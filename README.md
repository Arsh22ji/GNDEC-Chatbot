# GNDEC-Chatbot
The bot is built in Python and works on the process of tokenisation. It can respond user 24/7 about GNE's admission related queries and other FAQ'S.

Title:     GNDEC Chatbot. 
Components or element used: The working of Chatbot completely depends on Python and its in-built libraries.

Scientific principle:  The Bot checks for Input by user and tokenises the string value input on the basis of percentage matched with the suitable response and returns a suitable output to create an interactive communication with the user.

Working:   The bot first removes the unwanted string values from the input, then converts it into lower case and search for best match response (already provided to it) and thus returns the answer after checking the percentage matched and the condition of required words.

Application:
The GNDEC Chatbot can be deployed on the official GNDEC website so that users can interact freely with it to get information regarding admission processes or any other important issues along with some FAQ’s.

Benefits: The key benefits are:
1.	Users can interact without any hesitation with the Bot.
2.	Users can ask the same query as many times as they want.
3.	Bot will save time that would be wasted by the person solving queries on the call.
4.	Bot can answer any query at any time. It’s is present 24/7.
5.	GNDEC could extent it’s reach by the means of Bot.
6.	With more updated version we can analyse the user behaviour too.

Drawbacks:(chances of improvements);
•	Chatbot could be given a face using HTML and CSS.
•	Flask and JavaScript could make the Bot much better 
•	A feature could be added that can send a mail if something out of the Bot’s reach is asked.
